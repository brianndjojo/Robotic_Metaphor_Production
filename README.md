This is a proof-of-concept that implements **Metaphor Production w/ Python.** 

**Abstract** â€” The consensus of research into Creativity is that it is essential for Human-Intelligence. Creativity has many useful applications and being able to simulate it is considered a milestone. This paper simulates Creativity using Metaphors. 

**Metaphor Production is simulated programmatically through two experiments:** 
1) Robotic Metaphor Production 
2) Emotion-Bot

- The first experiment simulates the needed theory to generate Metaphors based on a predefined feature set, whereas the second experiment is an improved version which makes use of a semantic network. 

- Testing is only done on Experiment 1, and performance-wise it is acceptable but has a lot of limitations that need to be addressed. 

## For more details on the Literature-Theory behind Metaphors and how I implemented it please read the documents listed below:
